# Vision Zero Midblock Network Screening Paper

This respository hosts the in-development white paper for the Vision Zero
midblock pedestrian collision network screening project. It also serves as a
proof-of-concept for building as much reproducible reporting from a single
source of text. This includes:
- HTML for online documentation
- LaTeX for paper submissions
- PDFs for general distribution
- Word documents when collaborating with other teams or submitting 
  documentation to management for review.

The repo currently uses:
- [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html)
- [ghp-import](https://pypi.org/project/ghp-import/)

These can be installed using:

```
pip install jupyter-book ghp-import
```

The `midblockped` folder contains text, compiled HTML, and a detailed
`Readme.md` on how to write and build a Jupyter Book.

The `gh_pages` branch houses files automatically generated by `ghp-import` for
the repo's [GitHub page]
(https://toronto-big-data-innovation-team.github.io/vz_midblockped_paper/). Do
*not* manually alter this branch - any alterations will be deleted the next time
`ghp-import` is run!
