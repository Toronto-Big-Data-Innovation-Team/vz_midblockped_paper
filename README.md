# Vision Zero Midblock Network Screening Paper

This respository hosts the in-development white paper for the Vision Zero
midblock pedestrian collision network screening project. It also serves as a
proof-of-concept for building as much reproducible reporting from a single
source of text. This includes:
- HTML for online documentation
- LaTeX for paper submissions
- PDFs for general distribution
- Word documents when collaborating with other teams or submitting 
  documentation to management for review.

The `midblockped` folder houses text, compiled HTML, and a detailed `Readme.md`
on how to write and build a Jupyter Book.

This repo currently uses:
- [Jupyter Books](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html)
- [ghp-import](https://pypi.org/project/ghp-import/)

These can be installed using:

```
pip install jupyter-book ghp-import
```
